# page-qr

The Chromium extension that provides a simple way to get a QR code for your active browser tab.

What makes this different from other QR solutions? Well, it's 100% open source so anyone can review the code and see that this extension is so simple and that is really doesn't do anything with your data. Other than that? Not much, it is really that simple.

## Promise

This extension will always be open source and will never collect your information in any way.

## Usage

You install this extension through the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions) or [Edge Add-Ons](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/Microsoft-Edge-Extensions-Home). (For now it is only registered on the Chrome store so you'll have to go through the Chrome Web Store.)

Once it is installed you will see a QR code looking icon on your toolbar. Simply click the icon while on a webpage you want a QR code for.

## Why use this extension?

While I'm sure there are a bunch of ways to use it, here is the quick story of why it came to be.

> I was scroll through LinkedIn and I came to a video of an excerpt of a Ted Talk by Reshma Saujani (TED2016ing) - the founder of Girls Who Code. I have 4 daughters and I found Reshma's talk empowering to hear. So I wanted my girls to hear it. BUT I was looking at this on my computer. Sure I could have shared it to them via email BUT THEY NEVER check their email. So then I would have to text them or Snapchat them to look at their email. It hit me if I could simply have a QR code on my desktop, I could open that same page on my phone and then just send them a text. Simple. So, I created this simple extension to do just that.
